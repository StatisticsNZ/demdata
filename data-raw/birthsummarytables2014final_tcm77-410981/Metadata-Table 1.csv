Introduction,,,,,
,,,,,
"Most of the information, for both live births and stillbirths, is supplied to registrars by one or both parents. ",,,,,
,,,,,
"The date of birth is supplied in a conventional way, except where there is a multiple birth, then time of birth is also recorded. The sex of the child is also recorded.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Informants are required to provide further information, treated as confidential, under the provisions of the Population Statistics Acts (PSA). This includes mother's date of birth and father's/second parent's date of birth, if his/her name is entered in the register. Up until 28 May 2012, if the child’s parents were married to each other at the time of the birth, or when the child was conceived even if they later divorced or the father died before the child's birth, the number of previous children by her present husband and any former husband, (a) born alive, and (b) stillborn was also recorded. From 28 May 2012, the number of previous children has been collected from all mothers, not just married women. These confidential details are used for analyses of age of mother and birth order.",,,,,

Notes and definitions,,,,,
,,,,,
Coverage,,,,,
The births summarised here are those occurring (and then registered) in England and Wales for each calendar year. No distinction is made between births to residents and non-residents of England and Wales. A birth to a mother whose usual residence is outside England and Wales is assigned to the country of residence. These births are included in total figures for England and Wales. Births to residents of England and Wales which occur outside England and Wales are excluded.,,,,,
,,,,,
"The total number of births recorded in these tables includes births occurring in 2014 which were registered by 25 February 2015 and births occurring in 2013 which were registered between 26 February 2014 and 25 February 2015, that is births in the previous year which had not been tabulated previously.",,,,,
,,,,,
Registration of births,,,,,
"Every registrar of births and deaths is required to secure the prompt registration of births occurring within the sub-district covered. Registration of a birth is legally required within 42 days of its occurrence, and the registrar will, if necessary, send a requisition to the person whose duty it is to register the birth.",,,,,
,,,,,
"The duty of giving information is placed primarily upon the parents of the child but, in the case of death or inability of the parents, the duty falls on one of the other qualified informants.",,,,,
,,,,,
"The procedures and information required for stillbirths are similar to those for live births. The main difference is the recording of the cause of death of the stillborn child, on evidence given by the doctor or midwife present at the birth or who examined the body.",,,,,
,,,,,
Base populations,,,,,
"The population figures used to calculate rates in the tables are mid-year estimates of the resident population of England and Wales. These estimates include members of HM and non-UK armed forces stationed in England and Wales, but exclude those stationed outside. ONS mid-year population estimates are updated figures using the most recent Census, allowing for births, deaths, net migration and ageing of the population.",,,,,
,,,,,
The population estimates used were the most up-to-date when rates in this publication were calculated. The 2014 mid-year estimates were published on 25 June 2015.,,,,,
,,,,,
Terminology,,,,,
Births within marriage/civil partnership,,,,,
A birth within marriage/civil partnership is that of a child born to parents who were lawfully married/in a civil partnership either:,,,,,
"a. at the date of the child’s birth, or",,,,,
"b. when the child was conceived, even if they later divorced/were granted a civil partnership dissolution or the father/second parent died before the child’s birth",,,,,
,,,,,
Birth rates,,,,,
Various different birth rates are provided in the summary tables. An explanation of these rates can be found in the glossary.,,,,,
,,,,,
Quality of births data,,,,,
"The accuracy of information contained in the draft birth entry (Form 309 for a live birth or Form 308 for a stillbirth) is the responsibility of the informant(s) - usually the mother, or the mother and father/second parent where the registration is a joint one outside marriage/civil partnership. Wilfully supplying false information may render the informant(s) liable to prosecution for perjury.",,,,,
,,,,,
"It is believed that in general the information supplied by the informant(s) is correct. Computerised internal consistency checks are applied to each record to eliminate, as far as possible, errors made in the supply and recording of information on births.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Births that are registered using the RON system provide the opportunity for the registrar to make validation checks at the point of registration, therefore improving the quality of the data.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Prior to 2004 the donor record chosen to impute a missing data item was the most recently processed complete record of similar characteristics to the incomplete record. From 2004 to 2006 all imputed values for PSA data items were re-imputed using the Canadian Census Edit and Imputation System (CANCEIS) (Statistics Canada, 2005) which selects the most appropriate donor record from the entire annual dataset. Compared with the previous imputation system, this improved the distribution of imputed mothers' ages (especially in small areas) and the distributions for each of the other PSA data items.",,,,,
,,,,,
"In 2007 a new process was introduced to link live birth registrations, to their corresponding NHS birth notification record. Where mother’s age was missing on the birth registration and the registrations was successfully linked to a birth notification containing mother’s date of birth, the mother's date of birth was taken from the birth notification and mother's age was calculated. Any remaining missing PSA data items were then imputed using CANCEIS as in previous years. ",,,,,
,,,,,
"From 2012 mother’s age and father's age were imputed using the most recently processed complete record of similar characteristics to the incomplete record due to the very small number of records requiring imputation (0.04% and 0.07% of all live births had mother's age imputed in 2013 and 2014 respectively). From May 2012, missing data on the number of previous children has not been imputed. This is because the level of missing data is very low (the number of previous live-born children is missing on less than 0.7% of live births). Published tables now provide the information on the number of records where information on previous children was missing. ",,,,,
,,,,,
"There are a few, very small, known errors in the database each year which it is not possible to correct.",,,,,
,,,,,
Symbols and conventions,,,,,
,,,,,
In ONS birth statistics published from July 2014 onwards symbols used are:,,,,,
0 denotes nil,,,,,
z denotes not applicable,,,,,
: denotes not available,,,,,
,,,,,
"It is our practice not to calculate age-standardised rates, such as the Total Fertility Rate (TFR), where there are fewer than 10 births in total across all ages as rates based on such low numbers are susceptible to inaccurate interpretation.",,,,,
,,,,,
In ONS birth statistics published prior to July 2014 symbols used were:,,,,,
..   denotes not available,,,,,
:    denotes not appropriate/not applicable,,,,,
-    denotes nil,,,,,
,,,,,
"The new set of symbols used are being implemented across ONS outputs in order to improve harmonisation and consistency, and facilitate understanding of data and comparability.",,,,,
