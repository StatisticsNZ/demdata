1 The Total Fertility Rate is the average number of live children that a group of women would bear if they experienced the age-specific fertility rates of the calendar year in question throughout their childbearing lifespan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 The mean is standardised and shows the mean age of the mothers who had births in the year in question. This measure allows fertility trends to be separated out from the effects of changes in the populationâ€™s age structure over time. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 ONS recently completed a consultation surrounding the population estimates by marital status. This resulted in a change in the methodology used to produce the estimates for the years 2002 onwards. Population estimates by marital status for the years 2002 to 2010 have been revised and published in July 2015 alongside new population estimates by marital status for the years 2011 to 2014.  As a result of the change in the methodology, birth rates within and outside of marriage/civil partnership have been revised back to 2002 to reflect the revised population estimates by marital status.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 contained provisions enabling two females in a same sex couple to register a birth from 1 September 2009 onwards. Due to the small numbers, live births registered to a same sex couple in a marriage or civil partnership (22 in 2009, 335 in 2010, 417 in 2011, 556 in 2012, 655 in 2013, 713 in 2014) are included with marital births while births registered to a same-sex couple outside a marriage or civil partnership (2 in 2009, 140 in 2010, 191 in 2011, 252 in 2012, 259 in 2013, 277 in 2014) are included with births outside marriage.
