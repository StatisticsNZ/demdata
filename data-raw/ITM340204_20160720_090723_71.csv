"Actual series are counts derived from a sample of records from April 1975 to August 1997, and hence may contain sample error for these periods."
"Regions are territorial authority groupings that approximate regional council areas. Where territorial authorities span more than one regional council area, a territorial authority has been fully included in the region it is mainly in."
"New Zealand area data is not rebased when boundary changes occur. All data uses territorial authority boundaries which existed during the reference month."
